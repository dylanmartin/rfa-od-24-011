**Project Narrative:**
This project aims to enhance COINSTAC, a platform that enables secure, decentralized neuroimaging data analysis without the need to share sensitive patient data. By improving COINSTAC's capabilities and promoting its adoption, researchers can collaborate more effectively to understand neurological and psychiatric disorders. These advancements will facilitate the development of better diagnostics and treatments, ultimately improving public health outcomes for individuals affected by these conditions.

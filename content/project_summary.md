**Title:** Enhancing COINSTAC Capabilities and Adoption Through Sustainable Research Software Engineering

**Project Summary:**

The rapid growth of neuroimaging data and the increasing need for collaborative research necessitate robust, scalable, and sustainable software tools that adhere to best practices in software engineering. COINSTAC (COllaborative INformatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) is an NIH-funded platform that enables decentralized neuroimaging analyses while preserving data privacy. I have led a comprehensive rearchitecture of COINSTAC, significantly improving its reliability, scalability, and effectiveness. This rearchitecture included integrating advanced technologies such as NVIDIA FLARE and implementing modular code design and thorough documentation.

Building on this foundation, the proposed project aims to **enhance COINSTAC's capabilities and promote its adoption** across the neuroscience research community. As a Research Software Engineer (RSE), I will:

1. **Expand Platform Functionality:** Develop new features and computational capabilities within COINSTAC to address emerging research needs, such as advanced analytics, machine learning integration, and support for additional data modalities.

2. **Foster User Engagement and Collaboration:** Work closely with researchers to understand their specific needs, incorporate their feedback, and provide hands-on support for deploying and customizing COINSTAC in diverse research settings.

3. **Promote Best Practices in Software Development:** Continue to apply and advocate for robust software engineering practices, including code optimization, testing, continuous integration, and adherence to prevailing standards, ensuring the platform remains sustainable and adaptable.

4. **Enhance Accessibility and Usability:** Improve user interfaces, develop comprehensive documentation and training materials, and create user-friendly boilerplate repositories to lower barriers to entry and encourage community contributions.

5. **Facilitate Data Sharing and Compliance:** Extend features like COINSTAC Vaults to host high-quality datasets accessible for federated analysis without compromising data privacy, aligning with FAIR principles and NIH best practices.

This project directly addresses the NOFO's objective to support exceptional RSEs in contributing to NIH-funded biomedical research software while enhancing their professional standing and career continuity. By focusing on enhancing COINSTAC's capabilities and promoting its widespread adoption, the project will bridge scientists and software engineers, fostering collaborations that elevate both the specific research projects and the broader research software ecosystem.

The enhanced COINSTAC platform will empower researchers to conduct large-scale, privacy-preserving neuroimaging studies, catalyzing new discoveries and collaborations in neuroscience. This aligns with NIH's strategic plan to modernize the data ecosystem, fostering the adoption of robust software development practices and open science guidelines, ultimately accelerating biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and health-related research.

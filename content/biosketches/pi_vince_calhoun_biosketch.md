### **A. Personal Statement**

As a Distinguished University Professor and Director of the Tri-Institutional Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science (TReNDS), my research focuses on developing advanced methods for neuroimaging data analysis, particularly in the areas of data fusion, machine learning, and the identification of biomarkers for mental illness. Over the past two decades, I have led numerous NIH-funded projects aimed at advancing computational tools for understanding brain function and dysfunction.

I am fully committed to supporting Mr. Dylan Martin's application for the Research Software Engineer (RSE) Award. Dylan plays a crucial role in our NIH-funded project, COINSTAC, which is designed to facilitate decentralized neuroimaging analysis while preserving data privacy. His expertise in software engineering and his contributions to the rearchitecting of COINSTAC have significantly enhanced the platform's reliability and usability.

I will provide mentorship and collaborative opportunities to Dylan, supporting his professional development and ensuring the continued success of our research initiatives. His work aligns with NIH's strategic goals of advancing neuroscience research through innovative computational tools, and his continued contributions will be invaluable to our team and the broader research community.

### **C. Contributions to Science**

I have made significant contributions to the field of neuroimaging and data science. Below are five key areas of my work:

**1. Pioneering Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for fMRI Data**

I pioneered the application of independent component analysis (ICA) to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, enabling the separation of complex brain signals into meaningful components.

- **Significance:** This work allowed for the identification of resting-state networks and task-related brain activity patterns, advancing our understanding of brain function and dysfunction.
- **Publications:**
  - Calhoun VD, Adali T, Pearlson GD, Pekar JJ. (2001). A method for making group inferences from functional MRI data using independent component analysis. *Human Brain Mapping*, 14(3), 140–151.
  - Calhoun VD, Liu J, Adali T. (2009). A review of group ICA for fMRI data and ICA for joint inference of imaging, genetic, and ERP data. *NeuroImage*, 45(1 Suppl), S163–S172.

**2. Advancing Multimodal Data Fusion Techniques**

I developed methods for integrating data from multiple imaging modalities (e.g., fMRI, EEG, DTI) to provide a comprehensive understanding of brain structure and function.

- **Significance:** These techniques have improved the detection of biomarkers for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, facilitating early diagnosis and intervention.
- **Publications:**
  - Sui J, Adali T, Yu Q, Chen J, Calhoun VD. (2012). A review of multivariate methods for multimodal fusion of brain imaging data. *Journal of Neuroscience Methods*, 204(1), 68–81.
  - Calhoun VD, Sui J. (2016). Multimodal fusion of brain imaging data: A key to finding the missing link(s) in complex mental illness. *Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging*, 1(3), 230–244.

**3. Developing Tools for Dynamic Functional Connectivity Analysis**

I introduced methods for analyzing time-varying changes in functional connectivity, known as dynamic functional connectivity (dFC).

- **Significance:** dFC provides insights into how brain connectivity patterns fluctuate over time, which is crucial for understanding neural mechanisms underlying cognitive processes and mental disorders.
- **Publications:**
  - Calhoun VD, Miller R, Pearlson G, Adali T. (2014). The chronnectome: Time-varying connectivity networks as the next frontier in fMRI data discovery. *Neuron*, 84(2), 262–274.
  - Rashid B, Damaraju E, Pearlson GD, Calhoun VD. (2014). Dynamic connectivity states estimated from resting fMRI identify differences among schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and healthy control subjects. *Frontiers in Human Neuroscience*, 8, 897.

**4. Applying Machine Learning in Neuroimaging**

I have applied machine learning techniques to classify mental disorders and predict clinical outcomes based on neuroimaging data.

- **Significance:** This work contributes to personalized medicine by enabling the development of predictive models for mental health conditions, potentially improving treatment strategies.
- **Publications:**
  - Arbabshirani MR, Plis S, Sui J, Calhoun VD. (2017). Single subject prediction of brain disorders in neuroimaging: Promises and pitfalls. *NeuroImage*, 145(Pt B), 137–165.

**5. Developing COINSTAC for Decentralized Neuroimaging Analysis**

I have been instrumental in developing COINSTAC (COllaborative INformatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation), a platform that allows for decentralized analysis of neuroimaging data while preserving subject privacy.

- **Significance:** COINSTAC addresses data-sharing barriers by enabling collaborative analyses without the need to share raw data, facilitating large-scale studies and advancing open science.
- **Publications:**
  - Plis SM, Sarwate AD, Wood D, Dieringer C, Landis D, Reed C, Panta SR, Turner JA, Shoemaker JM, Carter KW, Thompson PM, Preda A, Mathalon DH, McEwen SC, Wang L, Pearlson GD, Calhoun VD. (2016).

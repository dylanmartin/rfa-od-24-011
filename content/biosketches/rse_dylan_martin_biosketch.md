**NAME:** Dylan Martin  
**eRA COMMONS USER NAME:** DMARTIN99  
**POSITION TITLE:** Full Stack Software Engineer - Sponsor Funded Professional at TReNDS Center  

### **A. Personal Statement**

As a Research Software Engineer at the TReNDS Center, I specialize in developing scalable, reliable, and extensible software solutions for decentralized neuroimaging data analysis. My primary focus is on COINSTAC (COllaborative INformatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation), an NIH-funded platform that facilitates federated analyses while preserving data privacy. I initiated a comprehensive rearchitecting of COINSTAC to enhance its reliability and effectiveness, integrating NVIDIA FLARE as the federated communication layer.

My work emphasizes modular and flexible code design, using TypeScript for strong type definitions, and maintaining thorough documentation and conceptual architecture diagrams. I am committed to advancing open science by developing user-friendly boilerplate repositories that encourage community contributions and by working closely with researchers to address their specific needs.

This RSE Award will enable me to continue enhancing COINSTAC, support the research community, and contribute to NIH's strategic goals of creating a sustainable ecosystem of high-quality research software tools.

**1. Rearchitecting COINSTAC for Enhanced Federated Neuroimaging Analysis**

I led a comprehensive overhaul of COINSTAC (COllaborative INformatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation), an NIH-funded platform facilitating decentralized neuroimaging data analysis while preserving data privacy.

- **Significance:** This rearchitecture enhanced COINSTAC's reliability, scalability, and effectiveness, enabling secure, large-scale federated analyses across multiple institutions without sharing sensitive data. It directly addresses the need for collaborative research tools that comply with data privacy regulations.
  
- **My Role:** As the lead software engineer, I architected the new system design, integrated **NVIDIA FLARE** as the federated communication layer, and implemented core functionalities. I introduced modular and flexible code structures, leveraging TypeScript for strong typing, which improved maintainability and reduced errors.
  
- **Outcomes:**
  - **Impact:** Significantly increased the system's realiability and user experience
  - **Code Repositories:**
    - COINSTAC-MINT: [https://github.com/trendscenter/coinstac-mint](https://github.com/trendscenter/coinstac-mint)
    - COINSTAC: [https://github.com/trendscenter/coinstac](https://github.com/trendscenter/coinstac)

**2. Promoting Open Science through Development of User-Friendly Boilerplate Repositories**

To facilitate the development of COINSTAC computations and promote open-source contributions, I created boilerplate repositories using **NVIDIA FLARE**.

- **Significance:** These repositories lower the barrier to entry for researchers and developers, fostering a community around open science and collaborative software development. They enable users to quickly develop and deploy their own federated algorithms.
  
- **My Role:** I designed and developed the boilerplate codebases, authored comprehensive documentation, and provided support to users, which empowered researchers to create custom computations.
  
- **Outcomes:**
  - **Impact:** Accelerated the development of new COINSTAC computations
  - **Code Repositories:**
    - MINT Computation NVFLARE App Boilerplate: [https://github.com/trendscenter/mint-computation-nvflare-app-boilerplate](https://github.com/trendscenter/mint-computation-nvflare-app-boilerplate)
    - MINT Computation Single Round Ridge Regression: [https://github.com/trendscenter/mint-computation-single-round-ridge-regression](https://github.com/trendscenter/mint-computation-single-round-ridge-regression)
